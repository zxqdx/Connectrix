# connectrix

Connectrix shows how Internet is connected. By inputting one or more domain, you can see how they are connected via statistics and graphs.

We use [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) to build the front-end web server. For parsing the big data from [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) dataset, we use tools in [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) ecosystem.
